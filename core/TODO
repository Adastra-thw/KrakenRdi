* Builds:
    - Delete builds is broken. In any case, it should delete everything, including containers created
    - Clean code.
    - If the user sends multiple times a request to create a image, what should be the behavior?
    - Implement detail endpoint
    - Implement delete endpoint
    - What about the logs in the "build" endpoint? Check builder.py -> ImageBuilder -> build()
* Container:
    - Check the workflow for creation of containers.
    - Implement delete endpoint
    - Implement detail endpoint
    - Implement execute endpoint
    - Implement filter endpoint
    - When connect via SSH, show as default shell /bin/bash
    - "list" enpoint don't show the current state of the container.
* Tools:
    - Implement list tools
    - Implement filter tools
* Misc:
    - General configuration in YAML file located in <USER_HOME_DIR>/.krakenrdi
    - Create a simple interpreter like MSFConsole.
    - Artworks
    - Documentation for users
    - Record some videos with features of this tool.
    - Test this tool from a clean Instalation of CentOS, Debian and Ubuntu.
    - Upload the Dockerfiles to DockerHub.
DONE
* Builds:
    - In the creation of builds the API server should check if celery worker is running.
    - When use "overwrite" in Rest API, it should find and later remove the build in Database.
      Now it's creating a new document in database (duplication).
    - To find a build it should receive the tagname, but when listing in DB it shows the full image name. It could be confusing.

* Container:
    - Implement list endpoint
